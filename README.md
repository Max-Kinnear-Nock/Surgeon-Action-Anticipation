  This project explores the application of <strong>Deep Learning</strong> to 
  anticipate surgeons‚Äô next actions during <em>laparoscopic procedures</em>, 
  contributing to the emerging field of <strong>intra-operative AI</strong>. 
  While AI has made major advances in <strong>medical diagnostics</strong>, 
  its integration into the <strong>surgical workflow</strong> remains limited. 
  This work aims to bridge that gap.

Incorporate global temporal context (e.g., SuPRA, LoViT).

Train on more diverse surgical procedures for better generalisability.

Focus on clinical accuracy before tackling real-time deployment.
